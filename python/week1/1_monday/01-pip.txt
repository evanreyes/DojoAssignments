pip list shows what packages are currently installed. It looks like most of them were preinstalled when Python was installed via Homebrew.

Trying to install again gives a message that “requirement already satisfied”.

Freeze lists packages in “requirements format.” 

You can write a file with the requirements to the current directory.
